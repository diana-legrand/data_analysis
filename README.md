# Data Analytics Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics project portfolio. This repository showcases a collection of analytical projects that leverage real-world data to solve business problems through statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project is designed to generate actionable insights using tools such as Python, SQL, and leading data science libraries.

| Project | Description | Tools & Libraries | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Business Performance Analysis](business_metrics) | Conducted a comprehensive analysis of key business metrics, including LTV, ROI, and CAC, based on website visitor behavior. Assessed the marketing payback period.| `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `SciPy`, `Seaborn`|
| [A/B Test Evaluation](ab_test_marketing) | Analyzed the results of an A/B test for an e-commerce platform, validating its design and statistical significance.| `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`, `Seaborn`|
| [Churn Prediction Model](churn_prediction_using_ml) | Built and evaluated models using logistic regression and random forest to predict customer churn. Performed customer segmentation through clustering techniques.| `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `IterTools`, `Re`|
| [SQL-Based Market Analysis](sql_project) | Extracted and analyzed data from a relational database to identify market trends. Developed a new value proposition for an online store based on insights.|  `SQL`, `SQLAlchemy`, `Pandas`|
| [Customer Segmentation](clients_segmentation) | 	Identified customer segments based on product usage behavior to tailor marketing strategies. Tested hypotheses linking income, engagement, and churn.| `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Statsmodels`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `SciPy`, `IterTools`, `Re`|
