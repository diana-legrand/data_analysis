# Business Metrics Analysis


## Objective

To evaluate the return on marketing investment, identify the reasons behind underperformance, and develop actionable recommendations to help marketers optimize the advertising budget.

## Summary

The primary driver of marketing inefficiency was identified as the overinvestment in a low-performing channel that generated relatively few paying users while exhibiting a rising Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).

To improve overall marketing effectiveness, it is recommended that the marketing team: reallocate budget toward channels with stronger performance, reduce or eliminate spending on channels with insufficient Return on Investment (ROI), increase investment in high-ROI advertising channels, implement geo-targeting strategies, and intensify efforts to reach users in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as target desktop (PC) users who demonstrate higher retention rates.
