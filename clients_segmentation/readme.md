### ðŸ“Œ Customer Segmentation by Product Usage

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal**  
To identify meaningful customer segments based on product usage and provide actionable recommendations to improve loyalty among banking clients.

**ðŸ§  Overview**  
In this project, I used multiple clustering methods to segment bank customers and build detailed customer profiles. The analysis revealed several key insights:

- Thereâ€™s no significant difference in average income between customers using one or two products.  
- However, churn rates differ significantly â€” customers with **only one product** are less likely to churn.  
- Clients with **three products** show the highest churn rate, suggesting potential dissatisfaction.  
- This may indicate that the bank offers one or two strong products (e.g., debit or credit cards), while additional offerings may not meet user expectations.

Based on these findings, I developed tailored recommendations to help the bank reduce churn and refine its product strategy.
