# SQL-Based Market Analysis Project

## Objective

To analyze a book market database in order to identify key trends. The client is a company that recently acquired a major book subscription service. The insights generated from this analysis will inform the value proposition of a new product.

## Conclusion

Using SQL queries, the project explored data on books, publishers, authors, and user reviews. Key findings include: identification of the most popular books and authors, recommendations to purchase more contemporary titles as well as books with strong user ratings and reviews, suggestions to prioritize partnerships with reliable publishers. Notably, the author duo J.K. Rowling/Mary GrandPr√© has the highest average rating (4.28) among books with over 50 reviews, indicating high reader approval and brand recognition. It is recommended that the online store increase its stock of their books, as they are likely to be well-received by customers.
